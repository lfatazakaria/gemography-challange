Hello  

Before i start to talk about the challenge, i would like to thank u for having such amazing process like giving the opportunity to show our skills in programming.

About the choise of using react i used it beacause it lets you build rich user-interfaces easily and simply, easy to read and implement, allowing businesses to hit the ground running and build what they need as quickly as possible.
Beyond that, Businesses that use ReactJS are assured of better performance compared to those that use other frameworks, it means that the apps will be faster and deliver better UX. ReactJS was designed to help improve the total rendered pages from the website server.

for more information, I wrote a comment for each step in the code.
